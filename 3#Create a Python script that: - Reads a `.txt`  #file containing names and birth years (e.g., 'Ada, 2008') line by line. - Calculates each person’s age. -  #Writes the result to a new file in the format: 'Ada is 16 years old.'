3#Create a Python script that: - Reads a `.txt` 
#file containing names and birth years (e.g., 'Ada, 2008') line by line. - Calculates each personâ€™s age. - 
#Writes the result to a new file in the format: 'Ada is 16 years old.' 
txt = "bolu is{age} years old" 
#txt = "ada" "2005"
print ("age" in txt)
birth_year = 2005

age = current_year - birth_year
output_line = f"{name} is {age} years old.\n"
            
            # Write to output file
#outfile.write(output_line)
